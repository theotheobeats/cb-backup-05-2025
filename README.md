# 🚀 Welcome to Your Expo App

This project was bootstrapped with [**create-expo-app**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), using the [**Expo**](https://expo.dev) framework to build universal apps for **iOS**, **Android**, and the **Web** — all from a single codebase.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your app up and running:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

After running the command, you'll be presented with several options to open the app in your preferred environment:

- 📱 [Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- 🤖 [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- 🍏 [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- 🔁 [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) — a lightweight way to preview your app on a real device

---

## 📁 Project Structure

All development happens inside the `app/` directory using [**file-based routing**](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

---

## 🧼 Reset Project

Want to start fresh? Run the following:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will:

- Move the existing starter code to `app-example/`
- Generate a new, empty `app/` directory for you to begin development
